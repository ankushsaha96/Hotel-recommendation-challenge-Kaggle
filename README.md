# Hotel-recommendation-challenge-Kaggle
In the app we have added 2 buttons. 
	1. New user - It will take user details like name,gender,location,food preferences and will recommend 5 restaurants based on their selection. if some options are
			  not selected, default option will be selected for that user.

	2. Existing user - This will take user name as input, but will take some random user from its database and will recommend 5 restaurants based on their order history.
